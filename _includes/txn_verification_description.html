<h3>Transaction Verification</h3>

<p>
In certain cases when you are unsure of the results of the transaction, such as when a transaction times out, you may need to double-check its status. You can run the verifyTransaction() method to perform this check.  This method returns a receipt containing the results of the transaction.
