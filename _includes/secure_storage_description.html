<h3>
Secure Storage
</h3>

<p>
With the Secure Storage API, merchants can remotely store credit card and other sensitive customer data with SALT to increase security and reduce the scope of PCI Compliance.
</p>
<p>
When information is stored with SALT, a ‘Storage Token’ (which identifies the information in secure storage) is returned in response.  This Storage Token can be used for all subsequent transactions including purchases and credit card verification.
